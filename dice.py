    'x'       create a new file and open it for writing
    'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
    So, I should be able to create a new file with a timestamp, OR just keep appending
    to the end of an existing file, depending on the timestamp of each new entry. Now
    to consider which option I prefer.

#Can I concatenate a timestamp string to the end of the file name, to make a new log file
#each time I run this? Now it's just overwriting the file, 
#which is fine for testing, not production

#Eventually I'll want to test for non-valid entries (non-numbers)
#but I'm not sure how to do that yet. :-)


#Now I need to make 'end' non-case sensitive. Or, do I want to use a try/exception here, to CATCH
#the error?

#Also, it might be nice to capture the rolls to a log file, for reference. I'll use UTC timestamps
#to identify each roll

#I also need to include an option to roll multiple dice at once, like 2d6.

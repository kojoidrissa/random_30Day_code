# Projects for me to work on
During code sprints/Github challenges or otherwise; Updated 2017-09-17 during my 60-day code challenge.

## Home Inventory site
Inspired by [PyCon UY 2013: From a Python beginner to a Django developer in 6 months - Hannes Hapke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F5e6Nf7bQ8); 19:45 in. One of Javier Candeira's suggestions was to find a project that's small enough to finish, but challenging enough.

### Why I'll Care
-  I can do it in Django AND HTML/CSS/JS
-  It'll help me catalog what I've got as I move towards a more minimal life, which is important to me.
-  I should probably build in a function to let you track the size of your inventory or number of possessions over time. I can see how that would be useful to people wanting to build Tiny Houses too.

## Tiny House Traders
- I'm sure I've got some of this documented somewhere. Basically, as people taking on the Tiny House Life downsize from their old lives, they may want to share their excess stuff with OTHER Tiny House people first. So, kind of like a market place? Perhaps it'll connect to the Inventory site above?

## Where's That Been in Django
-  I keep hearing how great Django is for GeoSpatial stuff

## TX/RX projects
-  Tracking volunteer hours
-  Automatic tracking of Tables, their owners and when people cancel their Table Hacker memberships
-  Mission Monitor Board for Open House tour duty

## Contributing to a project
-  [Python Mentors - Python Core Mentorship](http://pythonmentors.com/)
    +  If I can contribute to Drupal Core, I can contribute to Python Core
    +  Ok, I've MADE a small contrib, but I STILL need to get more familiar with the [Python Developer's Guide](https://docs.python.org/devguide/) so I can continue this process
+  Continue my work on [PyVideo](http://pyvideo.org/)
-  The BeeWare projects, specifically [Podium](https://pybee.org/project/projects/applications/podium/) (which I'd like to start using) and [Batavia](https://pybee.org/project/projects/bridges/batavia/), where I got my challenge coin.
-  OpenPyXL? I've also wanted to contribute to MatplotLib

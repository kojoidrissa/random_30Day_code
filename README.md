random_30Day_code
=================

As part of my 30 Day Github Challenge, I'll be writing random bits of code. They'll go here.

##anonymize.py
-  For myself and to help encourage others to present

##K-Pop Video popularity monitor
-  Pulling views data from YouTube, comparing the changes in views overtime.
-  This project is VERY under-designed at the moment

##Version number
-  My long-anticipated personal version number generator.

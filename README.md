random_30Day_code
=================

As part of my 30 Day Github Challenge, I'll be writing random bits of code. They'll go here.

**2017-09-17 UPDATE**: I may rename this repo to remove the number of days, since I'm now doing a 60 Day challenge.

Also, see my [projects](projects.md) file for more ideas, as well as my [notes](notes.md) file. I should probably combine these.

## anonymize.py
-  For myself and to help encourage others to present

## K-Pop Video popularity monitor
-  Pulling views data from YouTube, comparing the changes in number of views overtime.
-  This project is VERY under-designed at the moment

## Version number
-  My long-anticipated personal version number generator.
    -  ZOMG can I just DO this already? I thought I had in JavaScript. I know I'd worked out the modulus thing in Python.
    -  This MIGHT also be an interesting Batavia project: Get the Python code to run in JavaScript and put it on a web page for FHWS?

## D&D Player/IF thing?
Also poorly designed. More an IDEA at this point

### Basic ideas
-  Use dictionaries to store stat data on PCs, NPCs and Mobs.
-  Use random number generation to "roll dice" during encounters
-  Use a database or files to store data and results? Not sure which I'll try first
-  Is this going to be a game/campaign, or an Interactive Fiction deal? Maybe one of each?

### Dice Roller
-  started with dice.py; it now 
    -  rolls until you type "End"
    -  keeps a log of
        +  type of die rolled
        +  roll result
        +  time stamp of roll

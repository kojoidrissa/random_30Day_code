random_30Day_code
=================

As part of my 30 Day Github Challenge, I'll be writing random bits of code. They'll go here.

##anonymize.py
-  For myself and to help encourage others to present

##K-Pop Video popularity monitor
-  Pulling views data from YouTube, comparing the changes in number of views overtime.
-  This project is VERY under-designed at the moment

##Version number
-  My long-anticipated personal version number generator.

##D&D Player/IF thing?
Also poorly designed. More an IDEA at this point

###Basic ideas
-  Use dictionaries to store stat data on PCs, NPCs and Mobs.
-  Use random number generation to "roll dice" during encounters
-  Use a database or files to store data and results? Not sure which I'll try first
-  Is this going to be a game/campaign, or an Interactive Fiction deal? Maybe one of each?
